# 🚀 Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

💻 **Runs the app in the development mode**.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

- The page will reload when you make changes.
- You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

🧪 **Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode**.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

📦 **Builds the app for production to the `build` folder**.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

- The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
- Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

⚠️ **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

- It will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.
- All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments.
